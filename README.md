HELP us save ASCII smiles!!!
The "ASCII Smiles" NFT is a collection of 12,000 randomly generated well-known smiles from our past. ASCII smiles (emoticons) were very popular in the late 1990s, and we want to keep the memory of this miracle in the blockchain forever.

We created a smart-contract that will host the whole collection on all most popular blockchains. Non-blockchain sources or IPFS will not be used. This guarantees that you will have access to your "NFT Smile Card" always while the Ethereum blockchain is operational. This also makes it possible to create countless community projects based on information from the ASCII Smiles smart contract.

12,000 ASCII Smiles NFT will be minted.
Every Smile is randomly generated during minting.
All stats and the images are stored on the blockchain.
You can assign a nickname for your NFT on the blockchain.
All parts are accessible for any smart contract.
ASCII Smiles is a community-oriented project. We will support our community, listen to your suggestions, and do giveaways!
