After the initial mint is complete, things are just <B>getting started</B> for the ASCII Smiles NFT community.
I consider the initial mint primarily as a <B>beginning</B> of future activities and as a strong community gathering
that will embark on the best NFT journey on the entire blockchain!

We are working on a <B>long-term</B>, <B>community-driven</B>, and <B>sustainable</B> roadmap. We are here and will continue to be
here for the <B>ASCII Smiles Community</B> because you trust us and support us by minting the ASCII Smiles NFT.

We want to hear directly from you about what is and is not working within our community. We will take your
suggestions and vote <B>together</B> on the best idea, find the problem and focus on a solution.

Below is our <B>roadmap</B> for the near and distant future.
==============================================================================================================
<B>UPDATE:</B>

It's very difficult (almost impossible) to get noticed by the crypto community if you do not have a
crypto-related background yet. <B>However</B>, I want to build a strong community around this project and future
projects. Therefore, I have decided to change this project to the <B>FREE to mint</B>. I hope this will be helpful
and give our future projects the background they need.

You can check previous Roadmap version <A href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmS4H6Wu1ZFfQ5jXFjtmiKTJbT6uVe2RUMhcRrwzrVMZWp/">[ HERE ]</A>.
==============================================================================================================


    <span>Phase 1: Pre-Launch</span>

- Expansion of our community to <B>10K members</B>.
- Expansion of Discord and Twitter.
- Build a <B>strong</B> community for our project.
- <B>Discuss</B> with the community important questions related to the launch.
- Partnership with other projects for <B>giveaways and collaborations</B>.
- <B>Giveaway $5K</B> to our community.
- Create a <B>white-list</B> group. Users who are on the list can mint 1000 ASCII Smiles NFTs at
  a <B>special price</B> and without gas wars.
- Pre-launch ASCII Smiles <B>NFT giveaways</B> for 100 NFTs (will be minted at launch).

    <span>Phase 2: NFT Sale</span>

- The “<B>ASCII Smiles Community</B>” for our NFT holders will be created on Discord. The only way to join this
  community is to prove that you own the <B>ASCII Smiles NFT</B>.
- This is a <B>FREE-to-mint</B> collection. This means you can mint an NFT only paying a gas FEES.
- You can make a donation during a mint if you want support us more.
- <B>50%</B> of the proceeds will go into the address controlled by the community and secured by hardware wallet.
- <B>50%</B> of the proceeds will be used for future development.
- <B>100 ASCII Smiles NFTs</B> will be airdropped to random minters!

    <span>Phase 3: After the sale</span>

- Metadata and images will be revealed <B>24 hours after</B> the mint sells out or mint closed.
- Rarity data will be collected by <B>rarity.tools</B> and <B>Rarity sniper</B>.
- OpenSea <B>Verification</B>.
- If we do not sell out, the community may decide to <B>discontinue</B> the mint.
- The <B>Community</B> fund will contain <B>50%</B> of all possible donations.
- The <B>ASCII Smiles Community</B> will decide on how to best use the community fund.
- This money CAN be used for:
    * supporting the <B>floor price</B> (giveaways of purchased NFTs),
    * <B>giveaways</B> for NFT holders.
    * <B>merchandise</B> store,
    * <B>advertising</B> for the collection,
    * donations to <B>charity</B>,
    * any cool ideas from the <B>ASCII Smiles Community</B>.

    <span>Phase 4: Utility (1 week after the sale)</span>

- The ASCII Smiles [ASC] utility <B>token</B> smart contract is deployed.
- Each ASCII Smiles NFT can mint between <B>0.1</B> and <B>10</B> ASC tokens daily.
- The <B>daily</B> amount is based on the Rarity parameter:
    * 0.1 token for the Common card,
    * 0.8 tokens for the Uncommon card,
    * 1.5 tokens for the Rare card,
    * 3 tokens for the Epic card,
    * 10 tokens for the Legendary card.
- <B>600</B> ASC tokens are minted daily for the <B>Community token pool</B>.
- The <B>ASCII Smiles Community</B> decides how the community token pool is used.
- The maximum supply is <B>60,000,000</B> ASC tokens (5,000,000 on every blockchain used).
- You will need to pay <B>50 ASC</B> tokens if you want to <B>change the name</B> of your ASCII Smiles NFT.
- You will need <B>ASC tokens</B> to participate in the future breeding game. You can create
  a new NFT based on the traits of the parents.
- You will need <B>ASC tokens</B> to mint cool and fun NFT collections from the team or community.
- The <B>AST token</B> will be used as a utility token in <B>future projects</B>.
- <B>100% of all royalty</B> from trading will be transferred to the public wallet controlled by the team.
- The team has decided, <B>solely by their own discretion</B> to use these funds to purchase and burn ASC tokens.
- Disclaimer: ASC token is a utility token and has no economic value. You will not share any profits or
              earnings by having ASC tokens. ASC is a decentralised ERC20 smart contract token that is
              not controlled by the team in any way.

    <span>Phase 5: Extension</span>

- As a real developer, I will <B>not stop developing</B> new products. :-)
- ASCII Smiles NFT is not just an image on our server (as most NFTs). Your NFT metadata and image
  are stored on the blockchain. This opens <B>unlimited possibilities</B> for new projects based on
  ASCII Smiles NFT.
- Our community fund can be used to fund the <B>development hackathon</B>. This will create new community
  projects around ASCII Smiles NFT.
- The <B>breeding</B> system will be revealed. You will mint a new NFT that is based on the parents' traits.
- A <B>new collection</B> will be revealed (also on-chain) minted with AST tokens.
- Another <B>interesting NFT collection</B> will be revealed (<B>on-chain metadata</B>) minted with AST tokens.
- A new big and <B>game-changing</B> NFT related project will be revealed (currently being worked on).
  AST token will be used as a utility token in this project.

This roadmap is great, but <B>not yet final</B>. I am sure we will have a lot of great ideas to expand on.
The <B>main reason</B> for creating this collection is to unite a strong "<B>ASCII Smiles community</B>".
The moral principles of this community will not be based on rappers, gold chains and lambas. I hope
we will bring together many <B>successful people</B>, <B>developers</B>, <B>creators</B> and <B>inventors</B> who are passionate
about new technologies and may even remember what <B>Fidonet</B> was all about :). They will make new friends
and help each other to <B>realise</B> unique and interesting ideas! (so inspiring ;))

<B>Join</B> our <A href="https://discord.gg/ngNVt2R2s2">Discord server</A> and we will discuss <B>your</B> ideas!
